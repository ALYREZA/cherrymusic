Getting Started
---------------

1. [We're on github](https://github.com/devsnd/cherrymusic). Checkout or download the cherry music sources, e.g.:

        $ mkdir cherrymusic
        $ git clone git://github.com/devsnd/cherrymusic.git ./cherrymusic
        $ cd cherrymusic

2. To use cherrymusic you need [CherryPy](http://www.cherrypy.org). There are two options:

[download]: http://download.cherrypy.org/cherrypy/3.2.2/

    - Install it. Use your favorite package manager,
      or [download][] it and do a manual install.

    - If you don't want to install: get the [download][] 
      and copy the `cherrypy` subfolder it contains 
      into the `cherrymusic` folder you created.

3. Now simply run the main script using python 3; it will prompt you for anything else.

        $ python cherrymusic

4. On first start: The server creates a config file for you. 
   Make the necessary changes and restart the server.

5. Open your browser and play some music!

        $ firefox localhost:8080

Side Notes
----------

By default it uses HTML5 for music playback and supports flash as fallback. 

Known Issues
------------

An active flash blocker can interfere with the web frontend. 
If you have trouble with things like track selection or playback, try whitelisting
the server in your browser's flash blocker / plugin manager.

Requirements
