cherrymusic \- a standalone HTML5 (with Flash fallback) music streaming server written in python.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
cherrymusic [OPTIONS]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
CherryMusic is a standalone music streaming server based on CherryPy and jPlayer. It is intended to be a personal alternative to Last.fm, Spotify, Grooveshark... you name it. 

.SH "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-h, \-\-help\fP"
Show a help message and exit.

.IP "\fB\-\-update [PATH [PATH ...]]\fP"
Update the media database. PATH must start with basedir or be relative to basedir.

.IP "\fB\-\-newconfig\fP"
Creates a new config file in your home directory, e.g. ~/.conifg/cherrymusic/config.new

.IP "\fB\-\-dropfiledb\fP"
Clears the file database. This might be necesary after a version jump.

.IP "\fB\-\-download\-stagger\fP"
Downloads the python module "stagger", an ID3-tag library, into the folder that also contains CherryMusic. It is used for indexing your music collection more precisely. (Should only be used when not installed using a package manager!)

.SH "FILES"
According to XDG Base Directory Specification, cherrymusic honors $XDG_DATA_HOME and $XDG_CONFIG_HOME. If these variables are empty or not set, files are stored using the standard path:

~/.config/cherrymusic/config
.PP
~/.local/share/cherrymusic

.SH "SEE ALSO"
\fBcherrymusic.conf(5)\fP, \fBcherrymusicd\fP(8)

.SH "BUGS"
On client:
.PP
CherryMusic might not work when Flashblock is enabled. Workaround: add the server ip to your flashblock whitelist.

On server:
.PP
Currently there is a bug in CherryPy, the server framework cherrymusic was built upon, that prevents serving files that have non-ascii characters in their name. A bug report with a description of a workaround has already been filed and I hope it will be resolved upstream soon.

You've found another bug in CherryMusic? That's awesome. Tell us about it! You can open an issue in the issue tracker of github (github.com/devsnd/cherrymusic/issues) and we'll take care of it.
